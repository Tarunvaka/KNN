# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

## Overview
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, easy-to-understand machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by making predictions based on the closest data points (neighbors) in the feature space.

## How KNN Works
1. **Choose the number of neighbors (k):** Decide how many neighbors to consider when making a prediction.
2. **Calculate the distance:** Measure the distance between the new data point and all other points in the dataset.
3. **Find the nearest neighbors:** Identify the `k` closest points to the new data point.
4. **Classify or predict:** For classification, the most common class among the neighbors is assigned. For regression, the average of the neighbors' values is used.

## Advantages
- **Simple to use**: No complex model-building process.
- **Flexible**: Works for both classification and regression.
- **No assumptions**: KNN doesn't assume anything about the data's distribution.

## Disadvantages
- **Slow for large datasets**: KNN can be computationally expensive when there are a lot of data points.
- **Sensitive to irrelevant features**: Unimportant features can hurt performance.
- **Choosing k**: The performance heavily depends on the value of `k` and can vary with the dataset.

## When to Use KNN
- Use KNN for small to medium-sized datasets where you need a straightforward model.
- It works well when the data has clear patterns and when the decision boundaries are not simple (linear).

## Conclusion
KNN is a versatile and simple algorithm that works well for many types of problems, especially when you need an easy-to-understand model without complex assumptions.
